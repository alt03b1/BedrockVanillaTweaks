# BedrockVanillaTweaks
Vanilla Tweaks Ported to Bedrock!

# NOTE:
I'm very sorry to say this, but the project is currently on halt. Me and alt don't really have the motivation right now, but we aren't saying thats the end. Just a break. All packs will still be there.

Thank you, Lithium

# [Texture Packs](../master/pages/texture_packs.md)

- Texture Packs modify textures and sounds

# [Datapacks](../master/pages/datapacks.md) - WIP

- Dont get too excited for this one, many of the packs aren't yet possible with the current bedrock engine
- But some will be definitely added

# [Crafting Tweaks](../master/pages/crafting_tweaks.md)

- Crafting Tweaks modify the crafting recipies of some blocks or items

# [Tutorials on how to install a .mcpack file](./TUTORIAL.md)

- Confused? Don't know how .mcpacks work or how to install them? This tutorial is simply made for you!
